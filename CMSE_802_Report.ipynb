    "# Machine Learning Phase Transitions in the 2D Ising Model\n",

The project explores how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can identify the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, learn temperature from raw spin configurations, and estimate the critical temperature.\n",

    "## 1. Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D Ising model is a classical model in statistical mechanics describing spins on a lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. It is described by the simple Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = -J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} s_i s_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the $s_i = \\{-1, 1\\}$ are  binary magnetic moments (spins) sitting on a two-dimensional square lattice, and $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ indicates that only interactions between neighboring spins are taken into account. For simplicity, we will set \\(J = 1\\). At low temperatures, the system is ordered (almost all spins are aligned), but if we raise the temperature above a critical temperature Tc, the temperature fluctuations destroy the order and there is no preferred spin alignment any more (compare Fig. 1). Therefore, there exists a phase transition and the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the transiition occurs was calculated by Lars Onsager in 1944 to be :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_c = \\frac{2}{\\log(1 + \\sqrt{2})} = 2.269\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below $T_c$, spins tend to align → ordered phase.  \n",
    "Above $T_c$, thermal fluctuations dominate → disordered phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Research Questions**\n",
    "1. Can a CNN learn to classify Ising configurations into ordered vs. disordered phases?\n",
    "2. Can a CNN regress the temperature directly from the spin configuration?\n",
    "3. Can CNN be used to estimate the critical temperature at which such a transition occurs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning offers a powerful route to detect phase transitions *without explicitly computing magnetization or other order parameters*. This demonstrates how ML extracts physical structure from raw many-body configurations.\n",

    "The model needs to be trained for phase classification . For that we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is a deep learning architecture designed specifically for processing image data. It automatically learns hierarchical features directly from raw pixels using convolutional layers that detect local patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes. As the network goes deeper, these features combine to form higher-level representations of the image . We use the following architecture with CNN:\n",

    "## 4. Synthesis and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs successfully classified phases of the Ising model with high accuracy. CNNs also regressed temperatures from raw spin configurations. The learned critical temperature of 2.2-2.5 matches physics expectations reasonably well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Obstacles encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression becomes unstable near the critical region.\n",
    "- Some temperature predictions deviate due to strong fluctuations.\n",
    "- Overfitting was a risk due to small dataset sizes at individual temperatures.\n",
    "- Data preprocessing required careful balancing between classes.\n",
    "- The hyper parameter learning rate took time to adjust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 What we would improve\n",
    "- Use more temperature points to capture the transition well especially near transition temperature.\n",
    "- Try a more expressive architecture (ResNet-like small CNN).\n",
    "- Use unsupervised learning methods (PCA, t-SNE on features).\n",
    "- Train a classifier without labels to detect the transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates that machine learning, even with relatively simple CNNs, can:\n",
    "- learn phase structure directly from configurations\n",
    "- perform physical regression tasks\n",
    "- identify critical behavior without using the magnetization or any analytic order parameter"
