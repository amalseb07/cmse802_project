# cmse802_project
This project applies machine learning to study phase transitions in the 2D Ising model. Using Monte Carlo-generated spin lattices at various temperatures, a convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained to classify lattices as ordered or disordered and to predict the corresponding temperature.
